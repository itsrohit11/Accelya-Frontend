# 🚀 Getting Started with React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 📁 To Execute the Frontend Code

### ✅ Step 1: Extract the ZIP File

* Download and extract the project `.zip` file to your desired location.

### ✅ Step 2: Open Terminal in Project Folder

* Navigate to the extracted project folder.
* Open your terminal (or VS Code terminal) at this location.

### ✅ Step 3: Install Dependencies *(only if running for the first time)*

```bash
npm install
```

### ✅ Step 4: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
